# I'm `Suyashtnt`, `tnt_man1671`, `tnt man inc`, and `just a badly drawn TABS person` at once

## Random things I randomly do at random times

 - V i b e.
 - Play random games(Mostly TABS, Minecraft and TABG).
 - Code.
 -  - Make absolutely random APIS for no apparent reason.
 -  - work on frontends for some of them.
 -  -  - i know Svelte, Sapper and Vuejs.
 -  - - templates I usually use: 
 -  - - - [omega sapper GQL firebase](https://github.com/babichjacob/sapper-firebase-typescript-graphql-tailwindcss-actions-template)
 -  - - - [good old Svelte template](https://github.com/sveltejs/template)
 -  - mess around with things.
 -  - make Minecraft mods(fabric).
 -  - most things i make are open source.
## Things I know
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/): A frontend "framework" for making high performant, 0-dependency apps because it's a compiler.
- [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/): Next.js but for svelte, exept its way smaller and has minor differences.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/): A runtime for javascript using the V8 engine.
- [Deno](https://deno.land/): Node.js but does things better, written in rust and is _definitely_ not ready for prod. Also pronounced dee-no.
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/): API response thingy(like REST) but was made to be client-friendly, not server friendly. Takes like 20 lines of code for a hello world program but it provides sanity for large projects and has a typing system.
- [Unity](https://unity.com/): A 3D and 2D game engine using C#.
- [Express](http://expressjs.com/): Node.js web framework
- [Oak](https://oakserver.github.io/oak/): Express but for deno
- Some basic guitar.
